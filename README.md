## Project Purpose

- The purpose of this project was to mainly learn the GitHub work flow. From creating iueses and a branch then committing that branch and doing a pull request linking the issue to merge the local branch into the master and deleting the local. The app its self allowed you to preform CRUD along with a variety of listOf and numberOf methods. JUnit testing was done for everything and validation was done for certain fields being entered by the user.
